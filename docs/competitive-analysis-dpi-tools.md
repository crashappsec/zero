## Gibson Powers: Unique Value Propositions

### 1. Deep Build Inspection (No Competitor Offers This)

**What It Is**: Complete visibility into how software is built and deployed - analyzing build pipelines, deployment practices, build performance, supply chain components, and the entire software delivery lifecycle

**Why It Matters**:
- **Build Pipeline Analysis**: Understand CI/CD performance, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities
- **Deployment Practices**: Track deployment frequency, rollback rates, and deployment health
- **Build Performance**: Measure actual build times, identify slow steps, optimize workflows
- **Supply Chain Visibility**: SBOM analysis, dependency trees, vulnerability tracking
- **Reproducibility**: Verify builds are reproducible and attestation-backed

**Competitive Advantage**: DX, Jellyfish, and Swarmia only analyze git commits and issue trackers. They have zero visibility into the actual build and deployment process - Gibson Powers analyzes the complete software delivery pipeline.

---

### 2. Technology Intelligence (100+ Technologies)

**What It Is**: Automated detection of 100+ technologies, frameworks, and tools

**Why It Matters**:
- **Tech Debt Visibility**: See exactly what technologies are in use (and which are EOL)
- **Security Risk Assessment**: Identify vulnerable or outdated technologies
- **Migration Planning**: Data-driven decisions on framework upgrades
