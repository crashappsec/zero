## Active Priorities

### Priority 1: RAG Scanning Rules

**Rationale:** RAG patterns drive technology detection and need validation.

**Tasks:**
- Test RAG → Semgrep rule generation across all categories
- Validate generated rules against real repositories
- Identify false positives and missing detections
- Improve pattern coverage for edge cases
- Add test fixtures for rule validation

**Files:**
- `rag/` - 23 categories, 400+ pattern files
- `pkg/core/rules/manager.go` - Rule generation
- `pkg/scanner/technology-identification/rag_converter.go` - RAG to Semgrep

---

### Priority 2: Test Coverage

**Rationale:** Low coverage (6-47%) blocks confident releases and refactoring.

| Package | Current | Target | Complexity |
|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| `pkg/api/handlers` | 0% | 70% | Medium |
| `pkg/scanner/code-packages` | 8% | 70% | High |
| `pkg/scanner/code-security` | 28% | 70% | Medium |
| `pkg/core/scoring` | 0% | 70% | Low |
| `pkg/workflow/hydrate` | 17% | 70% | Medium |

**Approach:**
- Table-driven tests for scanner detection logic
- Mock external tools (semgrep, osv-scanner, cdxgen)
- Integration tests with test fixtures in `testdata/`

---

### Priority 3: Web UI Performance

**Rationale:** Dashboard unusable with current 500-2000ms response times.

**Plan:** `docs/PERFORMANCE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | SQLite storage layer | In Progress |
| Phase 2 | In-memory caching | Planned |
| Phase 3 | SWR request deduplication | Planned |

**Target:** <50ms API responses, <500ms dashboard load

---

### Priority 4: MCP Integration

**Rationale:** Enable Zero as MCP server for IDE integration.

**Current State:** Scaffolded in `pkg/mcp/`, not functional.

**Implementation:**
- MCP server exposing scanner results
- Tool definitions for each scanner
- Resource definitions for analysis data
- Integration with Claude Desktop / VS Code

---

### Priority 5: Reachability Analysis

**Rationale:** Prioritize actually-reachable vulnerabilities.

**Features:**
- Vulnerable code path detection
- Call graph analysis
- Risk prioritization based on reachability
