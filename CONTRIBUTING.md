## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, include:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Screenshots** if applicable
- **Environment details** (OS, Zero version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, include:

- **Clear use case** - Why is this enhancement needed?
- **Proposed solution** - How should it work?
- **Alternatives considered** - What other approaches did you think about?
- **Impact** - Who benefits from this enhancement?

### Contributing Code

1. **Skills** - New skills or improvements to existing skills
2. **Prompts** - Tested prompt templates for common use cases
3. **Tools** - Utilities that enhance the workflow
4. **Documentation** - Guides, examples, and references
5. **Tests** - Validation scripts and test cases

## Development Process

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zero.git
   cd zero
   ```
3. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes following our guidelines (see below)
2. Test your changes thoroughly
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Commit with clear, descriptive messages

### Testing Your Changes

🧪 **Use the Test Organization for safe testing:**

The [phantom-tests](https://github.com/phantom-tests) organization provides sample repositories for testing your changes without affecting real projects.

```bash
# Build the CLI first
go build -o zero ./cmd/zero

# Test hydration with quick profile
./zero hydrate phantom-tests/juice-shop all-quick

# Test with the security profile
./zero hydrate phantom-tests/juice-shop code-security

# Generate a report
./zero report phantom-tests/juice-shop
```

This ensures:
- Your changes work with realistic repositories
- No accidental modifications to real projects
- Consistent test environment for all contributors
- Example outputs for documentation

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of changes if needed.

Closes #issue-number
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(skills): add DNS analyser skill

Implements comprehensive DNS record analysis including:
- A/AAAA record validation
- MX record checking
- DNSSEC validation

Closes #42
```
