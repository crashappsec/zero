**Evidence:**
- GitHub Actions workflows present: WORKFLOW-001
- No provenance generation steps identified: SCAN-001
- No SLSA GitHub Action integration: WORKFLOW-001

**Cause:**
SLSA framework adoption not implemented in CI/CD pipeline configuration. No organizational policy requiring provenance generation for software artifacts.

**Effect:**
- Consumers cannot verify artifact authenticity
- Supply chain attack detection capability reduced  
- Non-compliance with emerging regulatory requirements
- Limited ability to trace artifact lineage

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (supply chain attacks increasing)
- **Impact:** High (integrity compromise potential)
- **Inherent Risk:** High
- **Current Controls:** Basic CI/CD present
- **Residual Risk:** High

**Recommendation:**
1. Implement SLSA GitHub Action for provenance generation

**Evidence:**
- Package health API failures observed: HEALTH-001
- Limited package metadata collection: HEALTH-001
- No deprecated package identification: HEALTH-001

**Cause:**
Dependency on external API services with reliability limitations. Lack of alternative health assessment mechanisms or cached health data.

**Effect:**
- Risk of adopting abandoned or poorly maintained packages
- Limited ability to assess supply chain stability
- Potential security vulnerabilities in unmaintained dependencies

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (tool limitations present)
- **Impact:** Medium (operational risk)
- **Inherent Risk:** Medium
- **Current Controls:** Basic vulnerability scanning
- **Residual Risk:** Medium
